Which of the following is posssible ?C1 = A'+B % -> 3x2 transp + 2x3 = 2x3 + 2x3 -> fineC2 = B*A % -> 2x3 * 3x2 -> inner match -> fine% C3 = A+B% C4 = B'*A% 2.

Let A be a 10x10 matrix and x be a 10-element vector. Your friend wants to compute the product Ax and writes the following code:A = ones(10, 10)*2;x = ones(10, 1)*3;v = zeros(10, 1)org_v = vfor i = 1:10  for j = 1:10    v(i) = v(i) + A(i, j) * x(j);  endend% 3. How would you vectorize this code to run without any FOR loops? Check all that apply.vva1 = A * x;% va2 = Ax; % not working of courseva3 = A .* x;va4 = sum(A * x);match = v==va1v = [1:7]w = [15:21]% 4. Say you have two column vectors v and w, each with 7 elements (i.e., they have dimensions 7x1). Consider the following code:z = 0;for i = 1:7  z = z + v(i) * w(i)end% Which of the following vectorizations correctly compute z? Check all that apply.z1 = sum (v .* w);z2 = w' * v;% z3 = v * w; % Not possible (1x7 * 1 x 7, no immer match)% z4 = w * v; % Not possible (1x7 * 1 x 7, no immer match)% 5. In Octave/Matlab, many functions work on single numbers, vectors, % and matrices. For example, the sin function when applied to a matrix % will return a new matrix with the sin of each element. % But you have to be careful, as certain functions have different behavior. % Suppose you have an 7x7 matrix X. You want to compute the log of every element, % the square of every element, add 1 to every element, and divide every element %by 4. You will store the results in four matrices, A,B,C,D. % One way to do so is the following code:X = magic(7);MTA = MTB = MTC = MTD = zeros(7); for i = 1:7,  for j = 1:7,    MTA(i, j) = log(X(i, j));    MTB(i, j) = X(i, j) ^ 2;    MTC(i, j) = X(i, j) + 1;    MTD(i, j) = X(i, j) / 4;  endend% Which of the following correctly compute A,B,C, or D? Check all that apply.MTA2 = log(X);MTB2 = X^2; # not possible this way, but via X.^2 elementwiseMTC2 = X+1;MTD2 = X/4;
