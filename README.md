###About###

This 11 week course imparts the knowledge about several machine learning techniques for all sorts of mundane business and industry tasks, from predicting sales based upon recorded data via automatic clustering of social groups, detecting anomalies within a production chain or building complex multi-component machine learning solutions and optimzing them.
